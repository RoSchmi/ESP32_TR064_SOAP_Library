## ESP32_TR064_SOAP_Library

This is a modification of:
https://github.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library
This modification works with http and https transport protocol

Arduino library to facilitate the use of the TR-064 SOAP protocol. 
With this you can get a lot of information from and control common routers and their peripherals, like the FRITZ!Box.

The original version https://github.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library claims the following features
A few examples of what you can do with it include:

Retrieve devices currently connected to the WIFI or LAN

Retrieve statistics on internet data usage

Turn WiFi on or off (e.g. Guest WiFi)

Make connected DECT phones ring (e.g. as a doorbell replacement)

Turn on and off connected Telephone answering machines

Get amount of power passing through connected smart plugs and take decisions on it

Turn smart plugs on or off


This library has been developed and tested on an ESP32. It was not tested on the ESP8266, find out by yourself if it works.

To get started, I recommend to use my example 'GitHub/RoSchmi/Esp32_Fritzbox_TR064_Phone_Absence'
